  name: Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI key file permissions are set to 600 (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    â€¢ Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Ensure that Kubernetes PKI key files have permissions of 600.
  rationale: >
    Kubernetes makes use of a number of key files as part of the operation of
    its components.

    The permissions on these files should be set to 600 to protect their integrity and confidentiality.
  audit: >
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    Control Plane node. For example,
    ```
    ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are 600.
  remediation: >
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the 
    Control Plane node. For example,
    ```
    chmod -R 600 /etc/kubernetes/pki/*.key
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, the keys used by Kubernetes are set to have permissions of 600
