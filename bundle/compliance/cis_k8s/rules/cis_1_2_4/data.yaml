  name: Ensure that the --kubelet-https argument is set to true (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Use https for kubelet connections.
  rationale: >
    Connections from apiserver to kubelets could potentially carry sensitive
    data such as secrets and keys. It is thus important to use in-transit
    encryption for any communication between the apiserver and kubelets.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--kubelet-https` argument either does not exist or is set to `true`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and remove the `--kubelet-https` parameter.
  impact: |
    You require TLS to be configured on apiserver as well as kubelets.
  default_value: |
    By default, kubelet connections are over https.
