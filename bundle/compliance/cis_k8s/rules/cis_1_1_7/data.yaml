  name: Ensure that the etcd pod specification file permissions are set to 644 or
    more restrictive
  rule_number: 1.1.7
  profile_applicability: '* Level 1 - Master Node'
  description: |-
    Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: |-
    The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in the master node.
    etcd is a highly-available key-value store which Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object.
    You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```

    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |-
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the Control Plane node.
    For example,

    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
  impact: None
  default_value: >
    By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file has permissions of
    `640`.
