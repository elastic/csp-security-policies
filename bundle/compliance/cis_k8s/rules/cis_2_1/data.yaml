  description: |
    Configure TLS encryption for the etcd service.
  rationale: >
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments
    for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should be encrypted in transit.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the etcd server node
    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```
    Verify that the `--cert-file` and the `--key-file` arguments are set as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Follow the etcd service documentation and configure TLS encryption.
    Then, edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` on the
    control plane node and set the below parameters.
    ```
    --cert-file=</path/to/ca-file>
    --key-file=</path/to/key-file>
    ```
  impact: |
    Client connections only over TLS would be served.
  default_value: |
    By default, TLS encryption is not set.
