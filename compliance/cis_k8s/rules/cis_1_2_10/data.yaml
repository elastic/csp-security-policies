  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin AlwaysAdmit is not set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not allow all requests.
  rationale: >
    Setting admission control plugin `AlwaysAdmit` allows all requests and do
    not filter any requests. The `AlwaysAdmit` admission controller was
    deprecated in Kubernetes v1.13. Its behavior was equivalent to turning off
    all admission controllers.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that if the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set, its value does not include
    `AlwaysAdmit`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`
    on the master node and either remove the `--enable-admission-plugins`
    parameter, or set it to a value that does not include `AlwaysAdmit`.
  impact: >
    Only requests explicitly allowed by the admissions control plugins would be
    served.
  default_value: |
    `AlwaysAdmit` is not in the list of default admission plugins.
