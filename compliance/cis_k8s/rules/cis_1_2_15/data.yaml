  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin PodSecurityPolicy is set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Control Plane Node
  description: |
    Reject creating pods that do not match Pod Security Policies.
  rationale: |
    A Pod Security Policy is a cluster-level resource that controls the actions
    that a pod can perform and what it has the ability to access. The
    `PodSecurityPolicy` objects define a set of conditions that a pod must run
    with in order to be accepted into the system. Pod Security Policies are
    comprised of settings and strategies that control the security features a
    pod has access to and hence this must be used to control pod access
    permissions.
    **Note:** When the PodSecurityPolicy admission plugin is in
    use, there needs to be at least one PodSecurityPolicy in place for ANY pods
    to be admitted. See section 5.2 for recommendations on PodSecurityPolicy
    settings.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes
    `PodSecurityPolicy`.
  remediation: |
    Follow the documentation and create Pod Security Policy objects as per your
    environment.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the --enable-admission-plugins parameter
    to a value that includes `PodSecurityPolicy`:
    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,PodSecurityPolicy,...
    ```
    Then restart the API Server.
  impact: >
    The policy objects must be created and granted before pod creation would be
    allowed.
  default_value: |
    By default, `PodSecurityPolicy` is not set.
