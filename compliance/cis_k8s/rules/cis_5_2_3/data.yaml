  name: Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the hostIPC
    namespace (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `hostIPC` flag set to
    true.
  rationale: >
    A container running in the host's IPC namespace can use IPC to interact with
    processes outside the container. There should be at least one
    PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit containers to share
    the host IPC namespace. If you have a requirement to containers which
    require hostIPC, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should
    carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts
    and users are given permission to access that PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether privileged is enabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.hostIPC}'
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which does not return true.
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.hostIPC` field is omitted or set to false.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.hostIPC: true` will not be permitted unless they are
    run under a
    specific PSP.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
