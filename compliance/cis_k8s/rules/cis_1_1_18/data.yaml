    Ensure that the controller-manager.conf file ownership is set to root:root
    (Automated)

    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The `controller-manager.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Controller
    Manager. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the
    file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `controller-manager.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
