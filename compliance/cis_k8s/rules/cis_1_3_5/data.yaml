  name: Ensure that the --root-ca-file argument is set as appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Allow pods to verify the API server's serving certificate before
    establishing connections.
  rationale: >
    Processes running within pods that need to contact the API server must
    verify the API server's serving certificate. Failing to do so could be a
    subject to man-in-the-middle attacks. Providing the root certificate for the
    API server's serving certificate to the controller manager with the
    `--root-ca-file` argument allows the controller manager to inject the
    trusted bundle into pods so that they can verify TLS connections to the API
    server.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```
    Verify that the `--root-ca-file` argument exists and is set to a certificate bundle file
    containing the root certificate for the API server's serving certificate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--root-ca-file` parameter to
    the certificate bundle file.
    ```
    --root-ca-file=<path/to/file>
    ```
  impact: |
    You need to setup and maintain root certificate authority file.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--root-ca-file` is not set.
