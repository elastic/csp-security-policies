  name: Ensure that the admission control plugin NodeRestriction is set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Control Plane Node
  description: |
    Limit the `Node` and `Pod` objects that a kubelet could modify.
  rationale: >
    Using the `NodeRestriction` plug-in ensures that the kubelet is restricted
    to the `Node` and Pod objects that it could modify as defined. Such kubelets
    will only be allowed to modify their own `Node` API object, and only modify
    `Pod` API objects that are bound to their node.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--enable-admission-plugins` argument is set to a value that includes
    `NodeRestriction`.
  remediation: |
    Follow the Kubernetes documentation and configure `NodeRestriction` plug-in
    on
    kubelets.
    Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--enable-admission-plugins` parameter
    to a value that includes `NodeRestriction`.
    ```
    --enable-admission-plugins=...,NodeRestriction,...
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `NodeRestriction` is not set.
