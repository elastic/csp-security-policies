  name: Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to
    root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the Kubernetes PKI directory and file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    Kubernetes makes use of a number of certificates as part of its operation.
    You should set the ownership of the directory containing the PKI information
    and all files in that directory to maintain their integrity. The directory
    and files should be owned by root:root.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    ls -laR /etc/kubernetes/pki/
    ```
    Verify that the ownership of all files and directories in this hierarchy is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown -R root:root /etc/kubernetes/pki/
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, the `/etc/kubernetes/pki/` directory and all of the files and
    directories contained within it, are set to be owned by the root user.
