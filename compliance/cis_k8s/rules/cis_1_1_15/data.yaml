  name: Ensure that the scheduler.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more
    restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `scheduler.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more
    restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `scheduler.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the Scheduler. You
    should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `scheduler.conf` has permissions of `640`.
