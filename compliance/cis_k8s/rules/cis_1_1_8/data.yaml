    Ensure that the etcd pod specification file ownership is set to root:root
    (Automated)

    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set
    to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`
    controls various parameters that set the behavior of the `etcd` service in
    the master node. etcd is a highly-available key-value store which
    Kubernetes uses for persistent storage of all of its REST API object. You
    should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The
    file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml` file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
