  name: Minimize the admission of containers with the NET_RAW capability (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not generally permit containers with the potentially dangerous NET_RAW
    capability.
  rationale: >
    Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the
    Container Runtime. By default this can include potentially dangerous
    capabilities. With Docker as the container runtime the NET_RAW capability is
    enabled which may be misused by malicious containers. Ideally, all
    containers should drop this capability. There should be at least one
    PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers with the NET_RAW
    capability from launching. If you need to run containers with this
    capability, this should be defined in a separate PSP and you should
    carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that only limited service accounts
    and users are given permission to access that PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether NET_RAW is disabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.requiredDropCapabilities}'
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which returns NET_RAW or ALL.
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.requiredDropCapabilities` is set to include either `NET_RAW` or `ALL`.
  impact: >
    Pods with containers which run with the NET_RAW capability will not be
    permitted.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
