  name: Minimize the admission of containers wishing to share the host network
    namespace (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not generally permit containers to be run with the `hostNetwork` flag set
    to true.
  rationale: >
    A container running in the host's network namespace could access the local
    loopback device, and could access network traffic to and from other pods.
    There should be at least one admission control policy defined which does not
    permit containers to share the host network namespace. If you need to
    run containers which require access to the host's network namespaces, this should be defined in a
    separate policy and you should carefully check to ensure that
    only limited service accounts and users are given permission to use that
    policy.
  audit: |
    List the policies in use for each namespace in the cluster, ensure that each policy disallows 
    the admission of `hostNetwork` containers
  remediation: |
    Add policies to each namespace in the cluster which has user workloads to restrict the 
    admission of `hostNetwork` containers.
  impact: >
    Pods defined with `spec.hostNetwork: true` will not be permitted unless they
    are run under a specific policy.
  default_value: |
    By default, there are no restrictions on the creation of `hostNetwork` containers.
