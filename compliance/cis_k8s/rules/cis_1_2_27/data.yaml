    Ensure that the --service-account-key-file argument is set as appropriate
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Control Plane Node
  description: >
    Explicitly set a service account public key file for service accounts on the
    apiserver.
  rationale: >
    By default, if no `--service-account-key-file` is specified to the
    apiserver, it uses the private key from the TLS serving certificate to
    verify service account tokens. To ensure that the keys for service account
    tokens could be rotated as needed, a separate public/private key pair should
    be used for signing service account tokens. Hence, the public key should be
    specified to the apiserver with `--service-account-key-file`.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--service-account-key-file` argument exists and is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the `--service-account-key-file` parameter
    to the public key file for service accounts:
    ```
    --service-account-key-file=<filename>
    ```
  impact: >
    The corresponding private key must be provided to the controller manager.
    You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based
    on your organization's key rotation policy.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--service-account-key-file` argument is not set.
