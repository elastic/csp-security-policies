  name: Ensure that Service Account Tokens are only mounted where necessary (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Service accounts tokens should not be mounted in pods except where the
    workload
    running in the pod explicitly needs to communicate with the API server
  rationale: >
    Mounting service account tokens inside pods can provide an avenue for
    privilege escalation
    attacks where an attacker is able to compromise a single pod in the cluster.
    Avoiding mounting these tokens removes this attack avenue.
  audit: |
    Review pod and service account objects in the cluster and ensure that the
    option below is
    set, unless the resource explicitly requires this access.
    ```
    automountServiceAccountToken: false
    ```
  remediation: >
    Modify the definition of pods and service accounts which do not need to
    mount service
    account tokens to disable it.
  impact: >
    Pods mounted without service account tokens will not be able to communicate
    with the API
    server, except where the resource is available to unauthenticated principals.
  default_value: |
    By default, all pods get a service account token mounted in them.
