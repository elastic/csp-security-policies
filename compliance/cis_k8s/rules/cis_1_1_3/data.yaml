    Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file permissions are
    set to 644 or more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the controller manager pod specification file has permissions of
    `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The controller manager pod specification file controls various parameters
    that set the behavior of the Controller Manager on the control plane node. You
    should restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file.
    The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, the `kube-controller-manager.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
