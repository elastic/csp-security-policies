  name: Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set
    to root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set
    the behavior of the `kube-scheduler` service in the control plane node. You should
    set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The file
    should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
