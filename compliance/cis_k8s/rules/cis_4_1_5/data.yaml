    Ensure that the --kubeconfig kubelet.conf file permissions are set to 644
    or more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Worker Node
  description: |
    Ensure that the `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `kubelet.conf` file is the kubeconfig file for the node, and controls
    various parameters
    that set the behavior and identity of the worker node. You should restrict its file
    permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the
    administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Automated AAC auditing has been modified to allow CIS-CAT to input a variable
    for the / of
    the kubelet config file.
    Please set $kubelet_config= based on the file location on your system
    for example:
    ```
    export kubelet_config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
    To perform the audit manually:
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/10-kubeadm.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`. Verify that the permissions are `644` or more
    restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the each
    worker
    node. For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kubelet.conf` file has permissions of `640`.
