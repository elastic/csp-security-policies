  name: Minimize the admission of containers with added capabilities (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Do not generally permit containers with capabilities assigned beyond the
    default set.
  rationale: >
    Containers run with a default set of capabilities as assigned by the
    Container Runtime. Capabilities outside this set can be added to containers
    which could expose them to risks of container breakout attacks. There should
    be at least one PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which prevents containers
    with capabilities beyond the default set from launching. If you need to run
    containers with additional capabilities, this should be defined in a
    separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that
    only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that
    PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    Verify that there are no PSPs present which have `allowedCapabilities` set to anything
    other than an empty array.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that `allowedCapabilities` is not present in PSPs for the cluster
    unless
    it is set to an
    empty array.
  impact: >
    Pods with containers which require capabilities outwith the default set will
    not be permitted.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
