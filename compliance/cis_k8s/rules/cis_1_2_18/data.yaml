  name: Ensure that the --insecure-bind-address argument is not set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not bind the insecure API service.
  rationale: >
    If you bind the apiserver to an insecure address, basically anyone who could
    connect to it over the insecure port, would have unauthenticated and
    unencrypted access to your master node. The apiserver doesn't do any
    authentication checking for insecure binds and traffic to the Insecure API
    port is not encrpyted, allowing attackers to potentially read sensitive data
    in transit.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--insecure-bind-address` argument does not exist.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the master node and remove the `--insecure-bind-address`
    parameter.
  impact: |
    Connections to the API server will require valid authentication credentials.
  default_value: |
    By default, the insecure bind address is not set.
