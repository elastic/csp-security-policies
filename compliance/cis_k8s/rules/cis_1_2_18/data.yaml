  name: Ensure that the --insecure-port argument is set to 0 (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Control Plane Node
  description: |
    Do not bind to insecure port.
  rationale: >
    Setting up the apiserver to serve on an insecure port would allow
    unauthenticated and unencrypted access to your control plane node. This would allow
    attackers who could access this port, to easily take control of the cluster.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the control plane node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--insecure-port` argument is set to `0`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the API server pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` 
    on the control plane node and set the below parameter.
    ```
    --insecure-port=0
    ```
  impact: |
    All components that use the API must connect via the secured port,
    authenticate themselves, and be authorized to use the API. This includes: 
    * kube-controller-manager 
    * kube-proxy 
    * kube-scheduler 
    * kubelets
  default_value: |
    By default, the insecure port is set to 8080.
