  name: Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set
    to root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the API server pod specification file ownership is set to
    `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The API server pod specification file controls various parameters that set
    the behavior of the API server. You should set its file ownership to
    maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `kube-apiserver.yaml` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
