  name: Minimize the admission of root containers (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 2 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not generally permit containers to be run as the root user.
  rationale: >
    Containers may run as any Linux user. Containers which run as the root user,
    whilst constrained by Container Runtime security features still have a
    escalated likelihood of container breakout. Ideally, all containers should
    run as a defined non-UID 0 user. There should be at least one
    PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) defined which does not permit root users in a
    container. If you need to run root containers, this should be defined in a
    separate PSP and you should carefully check RBAC controls to ensure that
    only limited service accounts and users are given permission to access that
    PSP.
  audit: |
    Get the set of PSPs with the following command:
    ```
    kubectl get psp
    ```
    For each PSP, check whether running containers as root is enabled:
    ```
    kubectl get psp <name> -o=jsonpath='{.spec.runAsUser.rule}'
    ```
    Verify that there is at least one PSP which returns `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the
    range of UIDs not including 0.
  remediation: |
    Create a PSP as described in the Kubernetes documentation, ensuring that the
    `.spec.runAsUser.rule` is set to either `MustRunAsNonRoot` or `MustRunAs` with the range of
    UIDs not including 0.
  impact: |
    Pods with containers which run as the root user will not be permitted.
  default_value: |
    By default, PodSecurityPolicies are not defined.
