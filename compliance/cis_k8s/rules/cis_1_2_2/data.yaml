  name: Ensure that the --basic-auth-file argument is not set (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Do not use basic authentication.
  rationale: >
    Basic authentication uses plaintext credentials for authentication. Currently,
    the basic
    authentication credentials last indefinitely, and the password cannot be changed without
    restarting the API server. The basic authentication is currently supported for convenience.
    Hence, basic authentication should not be used.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
    ```
    Verify that the `--basic-auth-file` argument does not exist.
  remediation: |
    Follow the documentation and configure alternate mechanisms for
    authentication. Then,
    edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml`
    on the master node and remove the `--basic-auth-file=<filename>`
    parameter.
  impact: >
    You will have to configure and use alternate authentication mechanisms such as
    tokens and
    certificates. Username and password for basic authentication could no longer be used.
  default_value: |
    By default, basic authentication is not set.
