  name: Ensure that the admin.conf file permissions are set to 644 or more
    restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Ensure that the `admin.conf` file has permissions of `644` or more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The `admin.conf` is the administrator kubeconfig file defining various settings
    for the
    administration of the cluster. You should restrict its file permissions to maintain the
    integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the following command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master
    node. For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None.
  default_value: |
    By default, `admin.conf` has permissions of `640`.
