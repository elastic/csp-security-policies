  name: Ensure that the API server pod specification file permissions are set to
    644 or more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the API server pod specification file has permissions of `644`
    or more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The API server pod specification file controls various parameters that set
    the behavior of the API server. You should restrict its file permissions to
    maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the
    administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, the `kube-apiserver.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
