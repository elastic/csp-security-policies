  name: Ensure that the --service-account-private-key-file argument is set as
    appropriate (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Explicitly set a service account private key file for service accounts on
    the controller manager.
  rationale: >
    To ensure that keys for service account tokens can be rotated as needed, a
    separate public/private key pair should be used for signing service account
    tokens. The private key should be specified to the controller manager with
    `--service-account-private-key-file` as appropriate.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```
    Verify that the `--service-account-private-key-file` argument is set as appropriate.
  remediation: |
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` 
    on the master node and set the `--service-account-private-key-file` 
    parameter to the private key file for service accounts.
    ```
    --service-account-private-key-file=<filename>
    ```
  impact: >
    You would need to securely maintain the key file and rotate the keys based
    on your organization's key rotation policy.
  default_value: |
    By default, `--service-account-private-key-file` it not set.
