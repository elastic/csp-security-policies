  name: Ensure that the RotateKubeletServerCertificate argument is set to true
    (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 2 - Master Node
  description: |
    Enable kubelet server certificate rotation on controller-manager.
  rationale: >
    `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` causes the kubelet to both request a
    serving certificate after bootstrapping its client credentials and rotate
    the certificate as its existing credentials expire. This automated periodic
    rotation ensures that the there are no downtimes due to expired certificates
    and thus addressing availability in the CIA security triad. Note: This
    recommendation only applies if you let kubelets get their certificates from
    the API server. In case your kubelet certificates come from an outside
    authority/tool (e.g. Vault) then you need to take care of rotation yourself.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the master node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kube-controller-manager
    ```
    Verify that `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` argument exists and is set to `true`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the Controller Manager pod specification file
    `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-controller-manager.yaml` 
    on the master node and set the `--feature-gates` parameter to
    include `RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true`.
    ```
    --feature-gates=RotateKubeletServerCertificate=true
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: >
    By default, `RotateKubeletServerCertificate` is set to "true" this
    recommendation verifies that it has not been disabled.
