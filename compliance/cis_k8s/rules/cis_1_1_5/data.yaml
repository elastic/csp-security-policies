  name: Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file permissions are set to
    644 or more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file has permissions of `644` or
    more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set
    the behavior of the Scheduler service in the master node. You should
    restrict its file permissions to maintain the integrity of the file. The
    file should be writable by only the administrators on the system.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
