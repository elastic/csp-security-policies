    Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file permissions are set to 644
    or more restrictive (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: >
    Ensure that the scheduler pod specification file has permissions of `644` or
    more restrictive.
  rationale: >
    The scheduler pod specification file controls various parameters that set the
    behavior of
    the Scheduler service in the master node. You should restrict its file permissions to
    maintain the integrity of the file. The file should be writable by only the administrators on
    the system.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %a /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
    Verify that the permissions are `644` or more restrictive.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    master node.
    For example,
    ```
    chmod 644 /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-scheduler.yaml
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    By default, `kube-scheduler.yaml` file has permissions of `640`.
