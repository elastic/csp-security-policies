  name: Ensure that the admin.conf file ownership is set to root:root (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Ensure that the `admin.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: >
    The `admin.conf` file contains the admin credentials for the cluster. You
    should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. The
    file should be owned by root:root.
  audit: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
    Verify that the ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    control plane node.
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf
    ```
  impact: |
    None.
  default_value: |
    By default, `admin.conf` file ownership is set to `root:root`.
