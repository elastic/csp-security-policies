  name: Ensure that the --client-cert-auth argument is set to true (Automated)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1 - Master Node
  description: |
    Enable client authentication on etcd service.
  rationale: >
    etcd is a highly-available key value store used by Kubernetes deployments
    for persistent storage of all of its REST API objects. These objects are
    sensitive in nature and should not be available to unauthenticated clients.
    You should enable the client authentication via valid certificates to secure
    the access to the etcd service.
  audit: |
    Run the following command on the etcd server node:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep etcd
    ```
    Verify that the `--client-cert-auth` argument is set to `true`.
  remediation: |
    Edit the etcd pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd.yaml`
    on
    the master
    node and set the below parameter.
    ```
    --client-cert-auth="true"
    ```
  impact: >
    All clients attempting to access the etcd server will require a valid client
    certificate.
  default_value: |
    By default, the etcd service can be queried by unauthenticated clients.
