  name: Ensure that the kubelet kubeconfig file ownership is set to root:root (Manual)
  profile_applicability: |
    * Level 1
  description: |
    If `kubelet` is running, ensure that the file ownership of its kubeconfig file
    is set to `root:root`.
  rationale: |
    The kubeconfig file for `kubelet` controls various parameters for the `kubelet`
    service in the
    worker node. You should set its file ownership to maintain the integrity of the file. 
    The file should be owned by `root:root`.
  audit: |
    SSH to the worker nodes
    To check to see if the Kubelet Service is running:
    ```
    sudo systemctl status kubelet
    ```
    The output should return `Active: active (running) since..`
    Run the following command on each node to find the appropriate kubeconfig file:
    ```
    ps -ef | grep kubelet
    ```
    The output of the above command should return something similar to `--kubeconfig`
    `/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig` which is the location of the kubeconfig file.
    Run this command to obtain the kubeconfig file ownership:
    ```
    stat -c %U:%G /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig
    ```
    The output of the above command gives you the kubeconfig file's ownership. Verify that the
    ownership is set to `root:root`.
  remediation: |
    Run the below command (based on the file location on your system) on the
    each worker node. 
    For example,
    ```
    chown root:root <proxy kubeconfig file>
    ```
  impact: |
    None
  default_value: |
    See the AWS EKS documentation for the default value.
