  name: Ensure clusters are created with Private Nodes (Manual)

    â€¢ Level 1
  description: >
    Disable public IP addresses for cluster nodes, so that they only have
    private IP addresses.

    Private Nodes are nodes with no public IP addresses.
  rationale: >
    Disabling public IP addresses on cluster nodes restricts access to only
    internal networks,

    forcing attackers to obtain local network access before attempting to compromise the

    underlying Kubernetes hosts.
  audit: ""
  remediation: ""
  impact: >
    To enable Private Nodes, the cluster has to also be configured with a
    private master IP

    range and IP Aliasing enabled.

    Private Nodes do not have outbound access to the public internet. If you want to provide

    outbound Internet access for your private nodes, you can use Cloud NAT or you can

    manage your own NAT gateway.
  default_value: |
    By default, Private Nodes are disabled.
