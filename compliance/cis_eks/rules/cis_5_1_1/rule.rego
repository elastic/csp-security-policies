To create a repository configured for scan on push (AWS CLI)

aws ecr create-repository --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE

To edit the settings of an existing repository (AWS CLI)

aws ecr put-image-scanning-configuration --repository-name $REPO_NAME --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true --region $REGION_CODE
Use the following steps to start a manual image scan using the AWS Management Console.
1. Open the Amazon ECR console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories.
2. From the navigation bar, choose the Region to create your repository in.
3. In the navigation pane, choose Repositories.
4. On the Repositories page, choose the repository that contains the image to scan.
5. On the Images page, select the image to scan and then choose Scan.`,

You can view errors like this in the Amazon ECR console by displaying the image details or through the API or AWS CLI by using the DescribeImageScanFindings API.
UnsupportedImageError You may get an UnsupportedImageError error when attempting to scan an image that was built using an operating system that Amazon ECR doesn't support image scanning for.
Amazon ECR supports package vulnerability scanning for major versions of Amazon Linux, Amazon Linux 2, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Oracle Linux, Alpine, and RHEL Linux distributions.
Amazon ECR does not support scanning images built from the Docker scratch image.
An UNDEFINED severity level is returned You may receive a scan finding that has a severity level of UNDEFINED.
The following are the common causes for this:
The vulnerability was not assigned a priority by the CVE source.
The vulnerability was assigned a priority that Amazon ECR did not recognize.
To determine the severity and description of a vulnerability, you can view the CVE directly from the source.`,
